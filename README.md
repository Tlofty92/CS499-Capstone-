## Self-Assessment

Throughout the computer science program, work on various projects has fostered both technical expertise and a practical understanding of software development challenges. Experience includes database management, full stack application development, and building graphical tools with OpenGL. These projects have refined skills in coding, testing, and problem-solving with a focus on real world applicability.

A notable project involved developing a client/server dashboard using Python, Dash, and MongoDB. This project connected a live database to a web interface where users could filter animal shelter data, visualize charts, and map animal locations. Key contributions included creating backend CRUD operations, implementing regex based filtering, and building an intuitive user interface. This work provided valuable experience in data handling, modular software design, and enhancing user interactions.

Another significant project entailed constructing a 3D graphics scene in OpenGL, which deepened understanding of computer graphics principles, such as transformations, buffer management, and the rendering pipeline. Attention to detail was critical, as precision in vector math and data flow directly affected rendering outcomes. This project expanded problem-solving abilities within a specialized domain.

Additionally, participation in team assignments and technical documentation efforts strengthened communication skills and the ability to clarify complex decisions clearly. A security conscious approach guided coding practices, emphasizing input validation and resiliency against unexpected conditions. These experiences mirror challenges commonly faced in professional software development environments.

Together, the portfolio artifacts demonstrate a broad skill set, encompassing software engineering, data processing, graphics programming, and effective communication. Collectively, they reveal proficiency in designing, constructing, and troubleshooting systems with an emphasis on practical, maintainable solutions.
